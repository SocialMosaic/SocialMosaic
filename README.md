# Social Mosaic

Social Mosaic is an app that allows users to upload photos to fill in "tiles" of a larger photo to create a mosaic that reproduces the original photo... socially.

## Core user stories (MVP)
- [ ] There is a collection of images for the user to choose from.
- [ ] User can select an image to use for a mosaic. When the image is selected, it appears full-screen.
- [ ] The full-screen image has a grid overlay.
- [ ] User can tap a "tile" to take a photo for that specific tile. The camera view fills that tile to allow the user to see how their photo would line up with the mosaic.
- [ ] After all tiles have been filled with photos, the user can save the mosaic as a photo on their phone.

## Optional user stories (nice-to-haves)
- [ ] User can share their completed mosaic on social outlets.
- [ ] User can see a list of past mosaics on the home screen.
- [ ] Multiple users can collaborate on a mosaic, each user filling out different tiles.
- [ ] User can use pinch gestures to zoom in and out on the grid when taking a photo (i.e., for when tiles are very small).
